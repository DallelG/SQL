#In this SQL project, I am working with a database with multiple tables in it and running queries to quantify statistics about customers
and order data. 


Question 1
How many orders were placed in January? 

SOLUTION
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


Question 2
How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SOLUTION
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


Question 3 
Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SOLUTION
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


Question 4
Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SOLUTION
SELECT DISTINCT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1


Question 5 
What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SOLUTION
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product


Question 6
Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SOLUTION
SELECT sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product


Question 7 
How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SOLUTION
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


Question 8
List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SOLUTION
SELECT product, sum(Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product


Question 9 
Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SOLUTION
SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID) > 2


Question 10
How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SOLUTION
SELECT sum(Quantity) as quantity, Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product


Question 11
What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SOLUTION
SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(customers.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers 
ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


Question 12
Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SOLUTION
SELECT product, sum(quantity), price, sum(quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID'
GROUP BY product 
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) DESC
limit 1
